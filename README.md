# add-gitignore

Interactive CLI application which generates `.gitignore` files for your projects.

## Usage

To install `add-gitignore`, you need [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed on your machine, and then you can use `cargo`:
```shell script
cargo install add-gitignore
```

Then, you can just type `add-gitignore` in your terminal and you will have a nice interface from where you can choose what `add-gitignore` should generate.
